# Project Title

_Sample Hello World Repository_

# Description

This is my first repository on GitHub. I will practice using various markdown syntax and other basic writing and formatting within GitHub. 

# How to Run Program

This is where I would explain the important details needed to run the program. This current repository doesn't have anything to run.


# Files Used

This is where I would list the files used in the project. I would also include relevant information like file names, where they're from, and other relevant information. Here is a table with some example files:

| Link & Name | Where It Was Found |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Super Bowl History](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/) | Pro Football Reference |
| [Global Retail e-commerce Sales 2014-2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) | Statista |

# Additional Documentation

Various Markdown syntax examples:
- ~~This text was an accident~~
- ***Very Important Text***
- **This text is _very_ important**
- A quote from me:
> I like chicken


# Versioning

This is the one and only version of this sample repository. If this was a larger project with many major changes throughout, I would document those changes here.
